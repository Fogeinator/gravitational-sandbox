display velocity (pull-line)

then edit initial velocity

scale of stuff (use orbit to show where they go)

calculate and display velocity
find required velocity for circular orbit

"mass" strokeWeight, let user use slider choose mass

add description of project below

pan around

remove text, force line on toggle orbit


gravitational sandbox 

- toggle orbits
- toggle orbital velocity trajectory display
- scale slider

- make it 3d??? three.js???
